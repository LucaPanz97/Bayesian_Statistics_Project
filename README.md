# Bayesian_Statistics_Project

# Goal

In this project we have worked on real-estate data with the goal of developing a model
which can predict and explain the price of houses.
Given the broadness of the scope of the project we have decided to start by developing
several models coming from well-known areas of research: mixed effect models, autoregressive processes [8], CAR models, Gaussian processes and latent Gaussian Markov
random fields. We have then selected the best models considering their computational
performance and the posterior inclusion probabilities of the regressors. Finally we have
created an ensemble model averaging the selected models with Akaike weights [7].
To fit and test the models we have used the Ames housing prices dataset [2], which
contains data on the houses sold in Ames (Iowa) between 2006 and 2010.
