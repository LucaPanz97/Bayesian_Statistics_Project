# Bayesian_Statistics_Project

# Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a Bayesian model for predicting and explaining house prices in Ames, Iowa.
Given the multifaceted nature of this task, we have opted to follow a comprehensive approach: 
1. Model Diversity: we explore a variety of models sourced from well-established research domains, including Mixed Effect Models, Autoregressive Processes, Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) Models, Gaussian Processes and Latent Gaussian Markov Random Fields.
2. Model Selection: to ensure the highest quality of predictions and insights, we rigorously assess the performance of each model and the posterior inclusion probabilities of the regressors. This meticulous selection process guides us in choosing the most effective models.
3. Model Ensembling: we create an ensemble model that amalgamates the capabilities of the chosen models using Akaike weights. This ensemble approach enhances our predictive accuracy and robustness.
